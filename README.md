# Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization

## SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN:

* Parallel Computing

** Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism

** Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework

** Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks

** Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)

** Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

* Java Concurrency & Optimistic Concurrency Control

* Distributed Computing
