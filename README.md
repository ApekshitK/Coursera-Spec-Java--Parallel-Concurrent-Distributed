 # Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization

## SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN:

* Parallel Computing

	* Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, Amdahl's Law, data races, determinism
	* Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
	* Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
	* Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
	* Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

* Concurrent Programming:
	* Threads and locks
	* Critical sections and isolation
	* Actors
	* Concurrent data structures
	* Optimistic Concurrency Control

* Distributed Computing
	* Distributed Map reduce
	* Client server
	* Message passing
	* Distributed Multithreading
